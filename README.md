# circle-to-search
Get Google's Circle to Search feature on your device!
Note: You may need to spoof the Google app to tell that you have a "Pixel 8" device. In that case, see my other repo (circle-to-search-spoofer)[https://github.com/fillwithjoy1/circle-to-search-spoofer]

# Notes
- You'll need to spoof your device as Pixel 7/8 series. Search up PixelProps and get the relevant props to spoof your device
- You will know if Circle to Search is working when you see this setting `Hold handle to Search` appear
