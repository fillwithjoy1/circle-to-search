# Guide
1. Install and flash this module
2. Reboot
NOTE: You will now need to spoof your device as Pixel 8. You have 2 options (with or without LSPosed)
a) Spoof the **entire device**, which may break apps (such as the GCam). In that case look into (PixelProps)[t.me/PixelProps], or (beta props)[https://www.pling.com/p/2129780/]
b) Spoof **just the Google app**. You **need LSPosed** for this
b2) Next download the Cts (Circle to Search) Spoofer from (here)[github.com/fillwithjoy1/circle-to-search-spoofer] and then enable in LSPosed. Reboot


# Notes
- You'll need to spoof your device as Pixel 7/8 series. Search up PixelProps and get the relevant props to spoof your device
- You will know if Circle to Search is working when you see this setting `Hold handle to Search` appear
