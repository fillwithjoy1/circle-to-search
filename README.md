# circle-to-search
- Get Google's Circle to Search feature on your device!
- Note 1: This works well on Pixel devices running Android 14
- Note 2: You'll need to spoof the Google app to tell that you have a "Pixel 8" device. This will be explored more in the guide.
- Note 3: Assistant features may be disabled after flashing. This is normal, you need to connect to Wi-Fi to finish setting up (see [#2](https://github.com/fillwithjoy1/circle-to-search/issues/2))

## Part 2 - Spoofing your device as Pixel 8
For this part, you'll need to spoof your device as the Pixel 8 app. I personally have another project that does that over [there](github.com/fillwithjoy1/circle-to-search-spoofer), follow the instructions over there and you'll be fine :)

Note: If you have your own spoofing solution, you'll need to trick the Google Search app (com.google.android.quicksearchbox)
